== About ==

Very plain and simple with minimal markup. Intended for website markup as well as a blog.
Keywords: one-column, two-columns, right-sidebar, custom-background, custom-header

== Description ==

Created as a clutter free in design for those whom prefer a website that presents a more static design layout.
But has plenty of blogging support. Feed support and RSS is defaulted in footer header.

One right-hand side widget. Three footer widgets. Top header widget should be used with discretion
possibly for a logo or user interaction button "text-widget" - maximum height is 200 pixels! Read functions.php, line 152
for details on how to arrange the widget to work with tag_clouds widget.

Clean looking style for titles and comments. Currently theme is in a default gray and white background and can be styled
preferably with a Child-Theme style sheet. Menus are pure CSS3 drop down style with pure HTML5 semantics, no divs.

No backwards compatibility, this is the current working version from TSW=|=.
